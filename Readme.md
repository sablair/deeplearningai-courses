## A Repository containing notebooks of courses done via DeepLearning.AI

The title says it all. As I complete the courses, if the associated python notebooks are available I will add them here.

Currently available are the python notebooks for:

- Generative AI with Large Language Models [Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) [Notebooks](Generative_AI_with_Large_Language_Models)
- LangChain for LLM Application Development [Course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/) [Notebooks](LangChain_for_LLM_Application_Development)
- LangChain Chat with your Data [Course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/) [Notebooks](LangChain_Chat_with_your_Data)
- LangChain for LLM Application Development [Course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/) [Notebooks](LangChain_for_LLM_Application_Development)
